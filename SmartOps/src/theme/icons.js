// Centralized icon system — every icon in the app is rendered through this one
// module, and every color it uses comes from `colors` (src/theme/index.js).
// That indirection is deliberate: when light mode is added later, only the
// `colors` palette needs to become theme-aware — nothing here, and nothing at
// any of the ~15 call sites across the app, has to change.
//
// One stroke weight app-wide ('regular'). Deliberate exceptions: tab-bar
// active state switches to 'fill' (a state indicator, not a second
// competing style), and an explicit `weight` override is available for the
// rare one-off that needs it (e.g. the FAB's plus, bolded for emphasis
// against a solid circle).

 * - `active` switches weight to 'fill' (tab-bar selected state) — everywhere
 *   else stays 'regular'.
 * - `color` overrides the default; when omitted, active icons use the app's
 *   accent (teal) and inactive icons use muted text — both from `colors`.
 * - `weight` overrides the active-based default entirely, for the rare case
 *   that needs a specific stroke weight rather than a state indicator. Note
 *   'fill' isn't just "thicker" for every glyph — some render as a solid
 *   shape (e.g. Plus becomes a filled square with a cutout). Use 'bold' for
 *   "thicker but still an outline".
